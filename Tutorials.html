  <text> Building a website like mine is simple, cheap, and fast</text>
  <text> The purpose of this tutorial is to set up a github pages with a custom domain name. This tutorial was wirtten by Ryan Kelsey to assist people in the creation of custom domain websites</text>
  <text> I will divide this tutorial into steps</text>
  <p/>
  <p/>
  <text>1) Find and buy domain name.</text>
    <text>       GoDaddy.com and NameCheap.com are both excellent options</text>
  <text>2) Change DNS settings of your domain name</text>
    <text whitepspace='pre'>       Within the settings of wherever you purchased your domain name, there will be DNS settings</text>
    <text>       We will make the following 5 changes</text>
    <text>          a) ADD an 'A' type rule, pointing to current domain name (commonly an @) on github's IP of 185.199.108.153</text>
    <text>          b) ADD an 'A' type rule, pointing to current domain name (commonly an @) on github's IP of 185.199.109.153</text>
    <text>          c) ADD an 'A' type rule, pointing to current domain name (commonly an @) on github's IP of 185.199.110.153</text>
    <text>          d) ADD an 'A' type rule, pointing to current domain name (commonly an @) on github's IP of 185.199.111.153</text>
    <text>          This routes the traffic to github's servers</text>
    <text>          e) ADD a 'CNAME' rule, with a name of www, and a value of your github page (user.github.io)</text>
  <text>3) Set up your github pages repository. Instructions can be found at https://pages.github.com</text>
  <text>4) Add a file named CNAME to your github page directory. Within this file write your domain name (example: ryankelsey.com)</text>
  <text>5) Commit changes</text>
  <text>6) Enable http protocol in your github pages directory. Settings->Pages->Enable HTTP[*]</text>
  <text>7) Enjoy your own website with your own domain name</text>
