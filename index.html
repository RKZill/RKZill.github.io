<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>My Name is Ryan Kelsey and this is the start to my website </p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a static website, domain name purchased on GoDaddy and routed to a github pages</p>
<p> Why? Well using a godaddy template is not impressive.</p>
<p> Sadly I am limited by the fact this is a client side website only, but I am looking into hosting my own backend with google cloud services!</p>
