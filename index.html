                    <p> The method of providing feedback on OSCIA's website was regarded as dated and non-intuitive.</p>
                    <p> When clicking the feedback button, the user's mail client is opened with the CC field prepopulated. While this does work, it lacks a visually appealing UI and there are no guidelines to submitting feedback, resulting in very vauge messages.</p>
                    <!--
        <p> For one of my first projects at OSCIA, I was tasked with the creation of an improved feedback process</p>
        <p> The old feedback method involved the user clicking 'feedback', which opened the user's mail client and prepopulated the 'To' field. This works for it's purpose but could be improved.</p>
        <p style="margin:0"> To improve this process, there was two key questions that needed to be looked at: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> The user's experince; How can I design a visually appealing UI that involves an easy to use process?</li>
            <li> The data collected; How can we gain more useful data through user submitted feedback, when the user can submit as little as they want?</li>
        </ol>-->

                <div class='border-box' style='background: #FFFFE0'>
                    <p> I was tasked with redesigning the feedback process, with the goal of providing a clean, inutuivie UI while simultanious increasing the amount of usable data collected. </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class='border-box' style='background: #d1e7b7'>
                    <p>To implement these changes a submittable form was chosen. This provdes advtnages as the UI can be customized rather than using the user's email client, and additional data can be transfered in the background.</p>
                    <p> The feedback form can be seen in an image on the right side of this page.</p>
                    <p>To improve accuracy and depth of the data collected, there are extra fields such as type of feedback, name, email, and more</p>
                    <p>To further improve the value of the feedback, data is collected in the background silenty. This involves IP address, current URL, web browser, OS, exact time, and more. </p>

                <div class='border-box' style='background: #ffcdd2'>
                    <p> Overall, the new format of submitting feedback was a great success. It provides a smoother user experince, guides the user into submitting complete feedback through input validation, and the increased data collection allowed the IT team to parse through spam emails much easier</p>
