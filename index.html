                    <p>For one of my first projects at OSCIA, I was tasked with the creation of an improved feedback process</p>
                    <p> The old feedback method involved the user clicking 'feedback', which opened the user's mail client and prepopulated the 'To' field. This works for it's purpose but could be improved.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0"> To improve this process, there was two key questions that needed to be looked at: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> The user's experince; How can I design a visually appealing UI that involves an easy to use process?</li>
                        <li> The data collected; How can we gain more useful data through user submitted feedback, when the user can submit as little as they want?</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class='medium-7 cell column'>
                <div class='border-box' style='background: #FFFFE0'>
                    <p> To improve user experince, a pop-up with a form was chosen.</p>
                    <p style="margin:0"> The form fields include validation which highlights the error field and dispalys a short error message.</p>
                </div>
                <div class='border-box' style='background: #d1e7b7'>
                    <p style="margin:0">To improve the data collected, a multitude of hidden data is collected to help further narrow down potential issues. This includes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> User IP address. This has proved useful in real applications, where our IT was able to use this tool to identify spam feedback coming from outside the country</li>
                        <li> User web browser. Knowing what browser the feedback came from can assist in the idenfication of browser specific issues.</li>
                        <li>Current URL where feedback has been submitted, for percisely knowing where exactly the issue was found</li>
                        <li> And much more! </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class='border-box' style='background: #ffcdd2'>
                    <p> Overall, user's do not submit a great amount of feedback, but this tool has helped improved the user experince when submitting feedback, and greatly improved the usibility of feedback that is submitted</p>
